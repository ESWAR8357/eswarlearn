    <h4>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
        AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Philosophy of AI</h3>
    <p>While exploiting the power of the computer systems, the curiosity of human, lead him to wonder, “Can a machine think and behave like humans do?”
            Thus, the development of AI started with the intention of creating similar intelligence in machines that we find and regard high in humans.

    <h4>Goals of AI</h4>
    <div class="pyc">
        <ul>
            <li>
                To Create Expert Systems − The systems which exhibit intelligent behavior, learn, demonstrate, explain, and advice its users.
            </li>
            <li>
                To Implement Human Intelligence in Machines − Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What is AI Technique?</h2>    
    <h4>In the real world, the knowledge has some unwelcomed properties −</h4>
    <div class="pyc">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Its volume is huge, next to unimaginable.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is not well-organized or well-formatted.
            </li>
            <li>
                It keeps changing constantly.
            </li>

    <h4>AI Technique is a manner to organize and use the knowledge efficiently in such a way that −</h4>
    <div class="pyc">
        <ul>
            <li>
                It should be perceivable by the people who provide it.
            </li>
            <li>
                It should be easily modifiable to correct errors.
            </li>
            <li>
                It should be useful in many situations though it is incomplete or inaccurate.
