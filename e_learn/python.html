    <br>
    <h4> Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</h4>
<div style="margin: 20px 60px;">
    <p>
    <b>Python is Interpreted </b> −  Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program <br>before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
    <br>
    <b>Python is Interactive </b>− You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
    <br>
    <b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
    <br>
    <b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

<p>Python is an open-source and cross-platform programming language. It is available for use under <b>Python Software Foundation License</b> (compatible to GNU General Public License) on all the major operating system platforms Linux, Windows and Mac OS. <br>
    <br>To facilitate new features and to maintain that readability, the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process was developed. This process allows anyone to submit a PEP for a new feature, library, or other addition.<br/>
    <br>The design philosophy of Python emphasizes on simplicity, readability and unambiguity. Python is known for its batteries included approach as Python software is distributed with a comprehensive standard library of functions and modules.<br/>    
    <br>Python's design philosophy is documented in <b>the Zen of Python.</b> It consists of nineteen aphorisms such as −</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Pythonic Code Style</h3>
<p>Python leaves you free to choose to program in an object-oriented, procedural, functional, aspect-oriented, or even logic-oriented way. These freedoms make Python a great language to write clean and beautiful code.<br><br>
    Pythonic Code Style is actually more of a design philosophy and suggests to write a code which is :
