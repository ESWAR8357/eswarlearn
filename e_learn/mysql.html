    <h4>MySQL is an open source relational database management system that was originally released in 1995.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>MySQL is popular among all databases, and is ranked as the 2nd most popular database, only slightly trailing Oracle Database. Among open source databases, MySQL is the most popular database in use today. Known as one of the most reliable and performative databases out there, it was named after itâ€™s founders daughter My, and is known for organizing data into one or more data tables in which data types are related to each other. These relations help structure data, as SQL is a language programmers use for creation, modification and extraction of data from a relational database. 

        MySQL uses standalone clients that allow users to interact with MySQL, and also to use it with other programs for applications that need relational database capabilities. MySQL's reputation for reliability has led to its inclusion in the popular LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python/Perl/PHP) and is also used as the default DBMS in popular CMS options like Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. </p>

    <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
    <div class="pyc">
        <p>MySQL is popular for a reason. It's an accessible database management system, and one that has been improved and iterated to improve its ability to manage modern problems. That said, MySQL does lock functionality behind paid versions of the DBMS. For those who need something beyond the core functionality, MariaDB may be a better option.</p>
