    <h4>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language that we can use for client-side or server-side development. It is a dynamically typed programming language, which means that we donâ€™t care about variable data types while writing the JavaScript code. Also, it contains the control statements, operators, and objects like Array, Math, Data, etc.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape and other web browsers.</p>
